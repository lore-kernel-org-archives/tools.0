Are there any policies or best practices on how people should/are
allowed to use this? From what I can see it seems one needs to change
the Product/Component of the bug to start a thread. I wonder if a few
maintainers that are active in bugzilla might be annoyed by this, as
that might break their workflow.

Which puts me in an awkward position when I see regressions reports in
bugzilla and would like to create threads for them. Using bugbot would
be better then the manual forwards I do now, like this one:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/ed31b6fe-e73d-34af-445b-81c5c644d615@leemhuis.info/


But here I decided to *not* use bugbot, as I know Kalle sometimes is
active in bugzilla -- and thus might hate it, if I re-categorize the bug.

Ciao, Thorsten
