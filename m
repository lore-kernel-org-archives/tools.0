How is this different from just running the kernel normally? Running
the kernel normally is simpler, faster, and more precise.

It may be more useful to invoke verification, but does not return
early on verification errors, but instead memorize the result, and
still always run the actual syscall normally. Then if verification
produced an error, but the actual syscall has not returned the same
error, then WARN loudly.

This should provide the same value. But also does not rely on
correctly marked manually written tests to test the specification. It
will work automatically with any fuzzing/randomized testing, which I
assume will be more valuable for specification testing.

But then, as Cyril mentioned, this verification layer does not really
need to live in the kernel. Once the kernel has exported the
specification in machine-usable form, the same verification can be
done in user-space. Which is always a good idea.

This will have additional risks, and performance overhead. Such
mitigations are usually assessed with % of past CVEs this could
prevent. That would allow us to assess cost/benefit.
Intuitively this does not look like worth doing to me.
