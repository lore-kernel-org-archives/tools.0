+cc xfs folks.

I have published a documentation website here:
https://kdevops-ng.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

It covers the project's concepts, terminology, deployment, roadmap and more.
I've also included a demo video to showcasing how to build the kernel
and run the fstest suite for XFS and review the results (all in Windmill UI):

https://kdevops-ng.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/demos.html

I'd also like to suggest holding an office hours session toward the end of 
this month (in about four weeks), so we can discuss about this, questions, etc.
