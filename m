30 days from my experience sounds too short for me (but I have no hard
numbers to back this up). I would have gone for 90 days, but I guess
that would create too much load?

Would be great if bugbot could CC the regressions list for all bugs that
have the regressions flag set to "yes"

How does one make bugbot forward a bug to everyone in the signed-off-by
chain of a commit that caused a regression, which might or might not
have a bugzilla account?  When the reporter performed a bisection these
are the primary contacts that need to be reached out to, but the
maintainers and lists for the subsystem obviously should be CCed.

Ciao, Thorsten
